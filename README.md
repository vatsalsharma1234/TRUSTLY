A community verification layer built on Google's open Plus Codes addressing system. Households register a Plus Code, neighbours who know them add a vouch, and the resulting trust score helps a delivery rider, ambulance driver, or first time visitor check an address before travelling there.

## What this project does

A household registers with a real Plus Code. Neighbours who actually know that household can vouch for it, and each vouch raises a transparent trust tier, from New to Highly Trusted. Anyone, a delivery rider, an ambulance dispatcher, a first time visitor, can look up that Plus Code and see the current trust tier before they travel there.

A printable marker with a QR code makes the doorstep itself discoverable offline. A simulated SMS path shows how the same lookup could work over a basic phone with no data connection at all.

## What it tries to solve

Roughly 68 percent of India's population lives where formal street addresses do not exist. Addresses are written as chains of landmarks instead, a village, a post office, a police station, a district. Google's Plus Codes solve the coordinate problem by giving any location a short, shareable code, but a code on its own carries no signal of trust. There is no built in way for a stranger to know if a given Plus Code is current, accurate, and actually tied to the household it claims to be.

Unclear addressing is a documented factor in delayed emergency response. DoorStep adds the missing layer on top of an already open addressing format, a lightweight, community verified trust score.

## Features

**Backend** (FastAPI + SQLite, Python)
- `POST /households`: registers a household. The Plus Code is decoded and validated server side with Google's `openlocationcode` library, rejecting short codes and invalid input.
- `GET /households/{plus_code}`: full detail including all vouches.
- `GET /households?locality=`: directory and search.
- `POST /households/{plus_code}/vouch`: adds a vouch, with a duplicate guard by phone or name.
- `GET /trust-score/{plus_code}`: quick trust check, meant for a delivery or dispatch tool before travel.
- `POST /sms/simulate`: mocks an offline SMS or USSD fallback. Sending `TRUST <PlusCode>` returns a one line reply.
- Auto-generated API docs at `/docs`.

**Frontend** (React + Vite)
- Home: live Plus Code lookup and registered households directory.
- Register: Plus Code validated against the backend on submit.
- Household detail: trust seal, vouch list, vouch form.
- Printable doorstep marker: QR code and Plus Code, styled for print.
- SMS fallback simulator: chat style mock of the offline path.

**Trust score model** (transparent by design, not a black box):

| Vouches | Tier            | Score        |
|---------|-----------------|--------------|
| 0       | New             | 0            |
| 1-2     | Building Trust  | 15-30        |
| 3-5     | Verified        | 45-75        |
| 6+      | Highly Trusted  | 90-100 (max) |

## Architecture

```
Browser
  |
  |  HTTPS
  v
React frontend (Vercel)
  |
  |  HTTPS + CORS
  v
FastAPI backend (Render)
  |
  v
SQLite (local file, via Python's built-in sqlite3)
```

Two independent deployments connected only by HTTPS and a CORS allowlist. No shared network, no shared filesystem.

The backend talks to SQLite directly through Python's standard-library `sqlite3` module (no ORM). `database.py` opens a connection per request and creates the schema on startup if it doesn't exist yet; `models.py` holds the plain SQL data-access functions the routes call.

On Render, the SQLite file lives on the free web service's disk, which is ephemeral across deploys, so data resets on every redeploy. That's fine for a demo; a persistent disk (or migrating the `sqlite3` calls in `database.py`/`models.py` to another database) is the way to get real persistence in production.

│   ├── schemas.py

```

`backend/` holds the FastAPI app: routes, models, schemas, the trust score and Plus Code logic, and the database engine setup. `frontend/` holds the React app: pages for each screen, shared components, the API client, and the design system.

## Run locally

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```
Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` to confirm it's up.

**Frontend** (new terminal)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:5173`. It points at `http://localhost:8000` via `.env.local`.

Full loop to try: register a household with a real Plus Code (generate one at [plus.codes](https://plus.codes) if needed), open its detail page, add a vouch, watch the trust seal update, open the printable marker, then send `TRUST <your code>` in the SMS simulator.
